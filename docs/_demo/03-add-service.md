We'll use the same process as in previous demos to add a new service to our existing aggregate repository:

1. Go to the `Actions` tab of the new repository on GitHub.
2. Select `Add service module` from the list of available workflows on the left.
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-add-service-workflow.png" alt="Add new service module workflow" %}
3. Click the `Run workflow â–¾` button and enter the service name as `handle-occurrence-filtering-service`: 
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-add-service.png" alt="Add new service" %}

   **Note:** Service names must be lowercase. Only alphanumerics and dashes are supported.
   {: .notice--warning}

   **ProTip:** End your service names with `-service` to make it clear the module contains a microservice.
   {: .notice--info}
4. Click the [Run workflow](){: .btn .btn--small .btn--disabled .btn--success} button below the service name.

This will kick off a workflow that adds the new module, containing the boilerplate code for a new service,
though you may need to refresh the web page to view it.

Wait for the workflow to complete and pull down the changes to your local machine by running:

```shell
git pull
```
